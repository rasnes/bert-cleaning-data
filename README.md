### Evaluation

- Images are not sharp - why?
- For basic slides it is okay, but custom formatting via CSS is too cumbersome for most of my presentation work. So, for the general case I must say I prefer a WYSIWYG tool like PowerPoint or Google Slides.
- However, if I want to present something with (much) code in it, I'd prefer `revealjs` for the nice syntax highlighting.
- That the slides can easily be hosted on Github Pages and works pretty well on mobile devices is of course to the liking.
